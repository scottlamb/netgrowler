<h1>NetGrowler Readme</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>This is <a href="http://www.slamb.org/projects/netgrowler/">NetGrowler</a>
version <b>0.2.1-dev</b>, which displays on-screen notifications of network
events (AirPort connect/disconnect, IP address changes, etc.) on an OS X
machine through the <a href="http://growl.info">Growl</a> framework.</p>

<p>NetGrowler is released under the MIT license, the full text of which is
below.</p>

<p>You need <a href="http://growl.info">Growl</a> version 0.6.1 to run
NetGrowler.</p>

<h2>Installation and use</h2>

<p>To start using NetGrowler:</p>

<ol>
<li>Save <tt>NetGrowler.app</tt> somewhere, perhaps
    <tt>/Applications/Utilities</tt>.</li>
<li>Launch it. Just click.</li>
<li>Verify it's running by looking for it in the Activity Monitor's list of
    running applications or looking for its output in Console.app.</li>
<li>Verify it actually works by pulling the network card or shutting down your
    airport. It should pop up a window when the network connections goes
    away.</li>
<li>Make it run on startup by going to Accounts within your System Preferences
    and adding it to your account's "Startup Items" tab.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Known Problems</h2>

<ol>
<li>It expects a Ethernet interface at "en0". If your system has only an
    AirPort, this might cause problems. (See the "XXX" in
    EthernetObserver.m.)</li>
</ol>

<p>Feel free to fix these and
<a href="mailto:slamb@slamb.org">send patches</a>.</p>

<p>If you find any other problems, please <a href="mailto:slamb@slamb.org">let
me know</a>.</p>

<h2>Future Enhancements</h2>

<p>Here are some enhancements I'm thinking about:

<ol>
<li>I could make a SystemPreferences pane, so there's an easier way to see if
    it's running and start/stop it. It'd also be a place to
    put&hellip;preferences. See the next point.</li>
<li>I could add in a way to assign friendly names to wireless networks (as
    a mapping to BSSID internally). Then you'd be able to distinguish
    between all the networks named "linksys" without guessing or memorizing
    their BSSIDs.</li>
<li>I learned from
    <a href="http://www.cocoadev.com/index.pl?AppleEightOhTwoEleven">this
    CocoaDev page</a> how to get a lot more information on AirPort networks.
    Base speed (11Mbps or 54Mbps), signal strength, channel, etc.
    I don't want to clutter the screen too much, so I have to decide what's
    most useful.</li>
<li>I could add localization support. I'd need help with this, as English
    is the only language I speak well. I have noticed a lot of downloads
    from Japan. Anyone?</li>
</ol>

<p>You're welcome to send patches for new features, too.</p>
