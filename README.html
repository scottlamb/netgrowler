<h1>NetGrowler Readme</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>This is NetGrowler version 0.1.0, which displays on-screen notifications of
network events (AirPort connect/disconnect, IP address changes, etc.) on an
OS X machine through the <a href="http://growl.info">Growl</a> framework.</p>

<p>NetGrowler is released under the MIT license, the full text of which is
below.</p>

<p>You need <a href="http://growl.info">Growl</a> version 0.5.0 to run
NetGrowler.</p>

<h2>Installation and use</h2>

<p>To start using NetGrowler:</p>

<ol>
<li>Save <tt>NetGrowler.app</tt> somewhere, perhaps
    <tt>/Applications/Utilities</tt>.</li>
<li>Launch it. Just click.</li>
<li>Verify it's running by looking for it in the Activity Monitor's list of
    running applications or looking for its output in Console.app.</li>
<li>Verify it actually works by pulling the network card or shutting down your
    airport. It should pop up a window when the network connections goes
    away.</li>
<li>Make it run on startup by going to Accounts within your System Preferences
    and adding it to your account's "Startup Items" tab.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Known Problems</h2>

<ol>
<li>It's overly noisy when waking from sleep. It tells you that your wireless
    connection went away and came back, that the Ethernet connection was
    disconnected, and that an IP was released and reacquired. I should monitor
    for system wake notifications and set a timer to calm this down.</li>
<li>The interface names are hardcoded &mdash; this could cause problems with
    machines that don't have a single Ethernet port as <tt>en0</tt> and a
    single AirPort as <tt>en1</tt>.</li>
<li>It doesn't track your primary IP very well yet.</li>
</ol>

<p>All of these are solvable with just a little effort. Feel free to do so
yourself and <a href="mailto:slamb@slamb.org">send patches</a>.</p>
