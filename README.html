<h1>NetGrowler Readme</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>This is NetGrowler version 0.2.0, which displays on-screen notifications of
network events (AirPort connect/disconnect, IP address changes, etc.) on an
OS X machine through the <a href="http://growl.info">Growl</a> framework.</p>

<p>NetGrowler is released under the MIT license, the full text of which is
below.</p>

<p>You need <a href="http://growl.info">Growl</a> version 0.6.1 to run
NetGrowler.</p>

<h2>Installation and use</h2>

<p>To start using NetGrowler:</p>

<ol>
<li>Save <tt>NetGrowler.app</tt> somewhere, perhaps
    <tt>/Applications/Utilities</tt>.</li>
<li>Launch it. Just click.</li>
<li>Verify it's running by looking for it in the Activity Monitor's list of
    running applications or looking for its output in Console.app.</li>
<li>Verify it actually works by pulling the network card or shutting down your
    airport. It should pop up a window when the network connections goes
    away.</li>
<li>Make it run on startup by going to Accounts within your System Preferences
    and adding it to your account's "Startup Items" tab.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Known Problems</h2>

<ol>
<li>It expects a Ethernet interface at "en0". If your system has only an
    AirPort, this might cause problems.</li>
</ol>

<p>All of these are solvable with just a little effort. Feel free to do so
yourself and <a href="mailto:slamb@slamb.org">send patches</a>.</p>

<p>If you find any other problems, please <a href="mailto:slamb@slamb.org">let
me know</a>.</p>
